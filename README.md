# GUI-stuff
Learning how to create GUIs in java through Bro Codes course on Youtube.

Link for his video: 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmgo00avvEw](Course)

I don't plan on watching the whole 4-hour video, but I will come back to the video(and possibly other youtube videos) while building independent projects
when I need help.
